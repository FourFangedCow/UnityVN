Hello Craig. My name is Jef the best person ever. I like to eat
pinapples on my pizza like a filthy heathen.

I'll bet you're friends with that connor guy, too. I hear he sometimes
rolls around on the floor pretending to be a slug.

He definitely does. But its okay because he's a pretty cool guy. I don't
know how much text I can put in a single block, but I should really test
out how much can fit. To be honest its probably way more than I'd ever
need to realistically type into one box. But this is a test. Ahahahaha.
